# localAIStack API Guidance

This directory contains the FastAPI service for local AI/RAG/vector workflows.

- `main.py` is the service entrypoint.
- `config.py` owns runtime settings.
- `core/reality_bridge.py` is the key RE/PE integration surface.
- `routers/` exposes chat, graph, GraphQL, health, and RAG APIs.
- `graphs/` contains agent/RAG flows.
- Use Pyright/Ruff and run relevant API tests after behavior changes.

## Standing rules — authoritative in `../../../RealityEngine_CI/docs/ENGINEERING_CONTRACT.md`

These apply here and are **not** restated in this file. The table is an index
to the contract, not a copy of it: it names every rule so you know what to look
up, and the contract's wording governs wherever the two differ.

| Rule | In short |
| --- | --- |
| Qualify every "registry" | Never the bare word — instance / machine / cesgen / arbitration / domain / semantic-bus / tag. |
| Regenerate a stale `<name>` registry, don't fail it | Each `<name>` registry is a view of the running system. A gate regenerates it and fails only on a disagreement that survives regeneration. |
| Verify a merge beyond the hosted checks | A green PR is not a verified PR; the hosted path cannot reach the integration points. Name what you could not exercise, and record what you noticed but did not chase. |
| _CI is the authority | Peripheral repos keep minimal CI that forces local validation; RealityEngine_CI verifies fixes against a live universe. Check its `docs/` before adding CI anywhere else. |
| Name it `CLAUDE.md` | Uppercase, always. On a case-insensitive filesystem `claude.md` is the same inode; dedupe on `st_ino`, never on a resolved path. |
| Never commit to main | Branch from `origin/main`, PR, verify, squash-merge, clean up. |
| Use bash, not zsh | Shell work runs in `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash` (5.x), not zsh or macOS `/bin/bash` 3.2: any loop, unquoted variable, glob or `set --` goes through it with `set -euo pipefail`, and you check the command's exit status, not the pipeline tail. |
